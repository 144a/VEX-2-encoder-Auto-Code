# VEX-2-encoder-Auto-Code

VEX Autonomous Code for bots with at least two encoders (preferably on the axles being driven)

The code has currently not been tested, but, in theory, should work on all of the bots made.

The only changes that need to be made to the code before actual use is updating the degree to tick ratio constant (DEGRAT) 
and the wheel diameter constant.

If there are issues, please tell me right away.
